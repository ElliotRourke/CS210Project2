# CS210Project2

#The goal of this project is for my team to create its very own operating system shell!

#There is a penalty of 10 marks for bad code thus code must:

#Not contain any commented out blocks left behind.

#Not contain any test printing left behind.

#Be properly formatted.

#Be well organized (i.e. broken up into reasonable, cohesive functions with
#no unnecessary fragmentation into files, minimal use of global variables, and
#reasonable variable and function names).

#Be well documented (i.e. description in code
#comments of all methods, assumptions that must hold at key points of the
#implementation, etc).
